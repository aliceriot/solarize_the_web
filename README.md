# Solarize the Web

A little chrome extension to style a couple of sites to match the
solarized-light colorscheme.

You can find it on the [chrome
store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/solarize-the-web/cglngnapainckmmknogiipogjcfbbeco).

I started with the css that
[alphapapa](https://github.com/alphapapa/solarized-everything-css) wrote,
and made a few customizations.
